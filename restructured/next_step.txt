Region:
    Flavors define the name of a region
Locations:
    Add more flavors
    Add Structure flavors
    Add creature profile to Locations (automatic from the terrains/Structures?)
    Creature profile includes respawn times, location keeps track (the Creature sends a message to the
        Location when it dies)
Map screen:
    Character location
    Region / Location details
    Exploration details
Optional: split the data into string and color (list[list[str]]), and let the UI combine the two at the end
