Creatures:
    Random: disappear when you leave the Location, rerolled every time. Terrains define the number,
      force defines the strength/type.
    Permanent: Local residents, villagers, farm animals, bosses, etc. Removed once killed/chased away.
      Have a probability value to show how often they can be found in the location.
    Spawn profile: A list of specific roles with set home locations, who are filled from a specific list
      of creatures. New creatures are added to the permanent list if there is an empty
      role and the role's timer has run out. Otherwise, they are skipped (e.g., you don't get a second bandit
      boss if the first one is still around).
    Random creatures can become permanent by taming or convincing to stay (need a home terrain).
    Respawning creatures are automatically created permanent.
    When entering a location:
        1) all permanents are loaded
        2) the spawn profile is updated using the terrains
        2) the roles of the permanents are subtracted from the spawn profile and any remaining
           gaps are filled if their last update has been long enough ago, adding the new creatures to
           the permanent list.
        3) random creatures are rolled and added.
    Creature priority: permanent > respawning. Random are always rerolled and added.
Locations:
    Add Structure flavors from the excel
    Add creature profile to Locations (automatic from the terrains/Structures?)
    Creature profile includes respawn times, location keeps track (the Creature sends a message to the
        Location when it dies)
Modes:
    Trade with creatures
    Masquerading terrains (ore veins, poisonous flowers, venom bushes)
Map screen:
    Exploration details
    Set destination command, add destination directions to HUD
Optional: split the data into string and color (list[list[str]]), and let the UI combine the two at the end
