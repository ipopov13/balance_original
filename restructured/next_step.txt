FEATURES
Add equipment to Inv view
Check max region name length - might break the map view in some combinations!

Only humanoids will need their own name generation
Humanoids are visible by their race name until you talk to them (the Creature keeps that state)
Build an AI library to choose from in species?
How to combine this with Humanoids having different AIs based on the profession?

Creatures:
    AI
        The creature knows the GOALS it wants (e.g., @, grass, rocks, a rabbit)
        The creature has priorities: a list of GOALS from which the current ones are chosen
        The creature passes the current list of GOALS to the Game
        The location finds the first GOAL the creature SEES and gives the next STEP towards it, calculating paths
        The Game gives the Location the coordinates of creatures, to make them available as GOALS
        The Game moves the creature on the STEP to the first GOAL
        ----
        The list of GOALS is the creature AI. Example fox priorities:
            0) meat (eat it)
            1) rabbit (kill a SmallAnimal instance to "make" meat)
            2) run(radius, distance) (protective mechanism, if a SentientSpecies is nearby)
            3) chosen random point in location
            4) hideout (hide on the terrain tile that generated the creature
        A subset of the list is chosen by the creature when the situation changes
        The list can be reordered based on the situation
    Random: disappear when you leave the Location, rerolled every time. Terrains define the type,
      chance defines the strength/rarity. The rarer the creature is, the harder it is to catch or kill.
    Terrain creature profile: weak common, stronger rarer, the rarest champion creatures
    Permanent: Local residents, villagers, farm animals, bosses, etc. Removed once killed/chased away.
      Have a probability value to show how often they can be found in the location.
    Spawn profile: A list of specific roles with set home locations, who are filled from a specific list
      of creatures. New creatures are added to the permanent list if there is an empty
      role and the role's timer has run out. Otherwise, they are skipped (e.g., you don't get a second bandit
      boss if the first one is still around).
    Random creatures can become permanent by taming or convincing to stay (need a home terrain).
    Respawning creatures are automatically created permanent.
    When entering a location:
        1) all permanents are loaded
        2) the spawn profile is updated using the terrains
        2) the roles of the permanents are subtracted from the spawn profile and any remaining
           gaps are filled if their last update has been long enough ago, adding the new creatures to
           the permanent list.
        3) random creatures are rolled and added.
    Creature priority: permanent > respawning. Random are always rerolled and added.
Locations:
    Add Structure flavors from the excel
    Add creature profile to Locations (automatic from the terrains/Structures?)
    Creature profile includes respawn times, location keeps track (the Creature sends a message to the
        Location when it dies)
Modes:
    Trade with creatures
    Exploration: Masquerading terrains (ore veins, poisonous flowers, venom bushes)
Map screen:
    Exploration details
